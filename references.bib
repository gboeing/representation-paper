A quantitative analysis of administrative and survey data finds that eviction is commonplace in inner-city black neighborhoods and that women from those neighborhoods are evicted at significantly higher rates than men. A qualitative analysis of ethnographic data based on fieldwork among evicted tenants and their landlords reveals multiple mechanisms propelling this discrepancy. In poor black neighborhoods, eviction is to women what incarceration is to men: a typical but severely consequential occurrence contributing to the reproduction of urban poverty.},

It also examines the bargaining that takes place once a match has occurred, with the bargaining taking various forms, including two-party negotiations of different types and multiparty housing auctions. The chapter reviews research on real estate brokers as intermediaries as well, focusing on the role of brokers in the matching and bargaining process, the nature of competition and entry in the brokerage industry, and the incentive issues that are present. The chapter also considers the inefficiencies that pervade the brokerage industry and the related policy debates. These are important issues both because of the inherent importance of housing and brokerage and because of the importance of housing to macroeconomic dynamics.},

Using the concepts of mental map and awareness space, we argue that search space is affected by households’ preferences, what is available on the housing market, and the use of information channels as well as their interactions. We hypothesize that households whose members disagree with each other have a larger search spaces than those whose members agree. Furthermore, the supply in the housing market and the use of different information channels may inﬂuence the search space differently for agreeing versus disagreeing households. We collected data from face-to-face interviews with 82 households (couples with or without children) who purchased a home in the New York City area between 2004 and 2009. The results support our hypotheses, suggesting that intra-household dynamics plays an important role in housing search.},

Because the Foursquare data can be combined with traditional sources of socioeconomic data obtained from Statistics Netherlands, we can quantify, document and characterise some of the biases inherent in these new sources of data in the context of urban applications. A detailed analysis is given as to when this type of big data is useful and when it is misleading. Although the users of Foursquare are not representative of the whole population, we argue that this inherent bias can be exploited for research about the attractiveness of urban landscapes and consumer amenities in addition to the more traditional data on urban amenities.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of digital real estate technologies. Often referred to as PropTech (property technology), these innovations might variously promise more eﬃcient portfolio management (e.g. VTS), new ways to rent accommodation (e.g. Airbnb), or hassle-free maintenance (e.g. FixFlo). Whilst commentators have debated their novelty as either highly disruptive or a temporary fad, few researchers have sought to fully theorize the digital real estate platform. And those that have provided overviews of the so-called PropTech landscape have failed to do so in a suﬃciently critical manner, instead opting for a raft of essentialist and categorical terms. Borrowing the lenses of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and platform studies, this paper develops a theory of digital real estate platforms to address this conceptual gap. And through a qualitative analysis of some 400 businesses, it provides a series of key observations of Platform Real Estate as an improved theoretical neologism to inform future research. These observations are important to better understand the nature of digital real estate platforms and the manner in which they may reconstruct future urban real estate markets – a subject of great concern to researchers and market participants alike.},

Here, we are interested in grappling with the current ‘place’ of smart cities in the context of what seems to be an emerging platform urbanism, thereby highlighting a complex platform-based ecosystem encompassing private and public organisations and citizens. Our point of departure is the operationalization of three intertwined trends associated with the conceptualizations of participation, mediatisation and (multi-sided) platformisation. Through the examination of (social) traﬃc and navigation application, Waze, we explore manifestations of (contested) dynamics in mobility practices occurring between commerce and community in the public space of the city. The preliminary ﬁndings point to the emergence of new socio-spatial constructs which aﬀord a better frame of ‘what is going on’, challenging the smart city framework as a planning and development paradigm. In putting forward the notion of public value and ownership, it is our aim to prompt a critical debate about platform urbanism made explicit by a driving politics that oﬀers a window to a future driving world, urging cities and governments to anticipate and mitigate (un)intended consequences.},

	issn = {0308-518X, 1472-3409},
	doi = {10.1177/0308518X18820917},
	abstract = {This article responds to Peck’s call for a heterodox economic analysis of markets that is sensitive to their sociality and spatiality with Polanyi’s work as a starting point. It is argued that while Polanyi’s concept of the socially embedded economy offers a useful heuristic for apprehending the social foundations of economic activity, his analysis exhibits ‘market fetishism’ – a tendency to treat markets as things in and of themselves, without a proper appreciation of their inherently social foundations – and that this is reflected in broader scholarly discourses with respect to markets. Thus, it is argued, we need to augment Polanyi’s framework with other heterodox economic insights. The article outlines a four-step approach to ‘de-fetishizing’ markets. First, the article foregrounds the specifically capitalist nature of the global economy, and the ‘unique system of market dependence’ to which capitalist social relations give rise. Second, it is argued that de-fetishizing markets requires that an agent-centred approach be adopted. Rather than viewing markets as ‘things’ it is argued that they are most usefully understood as the interactions between agents, the most significant of which, within the contemporary global economy, is the large capitalist firm. Third, the interaction between such agents is structured by pervasive frameworks of rules. Fourth, it is argued that markets are inherently spatial phenomena. They are spatially constituted and contribute to the production of space.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.04.008},
	abstract = {The availability and performance of broadband connectivity is becoming an increasingly important issue across much of the developed world as the prevalence of richer media services and growing populations have generated increasing demands on existing networks. The heterogeneous geography of broadband infrastructure and investments results in variable service provision, and as such, there exist large disparities in access and performance within different spatio-temporal locations. This paper presents analysis of 4.7 million crowdsourced Internet speed test results that were compiled between 2010 and 2013 alongside various indicators of socio-spatial structure to map disparities in English broadband speed between and within urban areas. Although average speeds have improved over time, inequity is shown to emerge between different societal groups and locations. Short-term dynamics also reveal that in areas of different density, speeds can fall dramatically during peak hours, thus inﬂuencing the availability of services. The apparent disparities in access and performance represent a major issue as Internet use becomes increasingly ubiquitous in our everyday lives, with inequalities evoking social and economic disadvantage at local and national scales. This work resonates with UK government policy that has stimulated considerable investment in improving infrastructure, and presents analysis of an expansive crowd sourced “big data” resource for the ﬁrst time.},

However, the adoption of user-generated geographic information has not been uniform, resulting in an uneven distribution of content and more nuanced digital divides. This paper uses a survey of Internet users to measure the gender divide in the contributions of cartographic information to the Internet and examine the impact of this divide within the context of OpenStreetMap and Google MapMaker. This paper argues that in both publicly available basemaps the gender divide results in men serving as the gatekeepers of local knowledge leading to gendered user-generated representations. As these digital basemaps are reproduced and utilized by almost every mobile application or web-based map, the gender divisions in the creators and content are endlessly reproduced.},

The rise of the geoweb is associated with shifts in the processes and power relations of spatial data creation and use, reconﬁgurations in previously bounded disciplinary knowledge sets, and shifts in the subjectivities and social relations that are produced through the geoweb’s technologies, data, and practices. This early research on the societal implications of the geoweb is drawing productively upon conceptual frameworks from critical GIS, public participation GIS, and spatial data infrastructure research, but must also theorize beyond these existing bodies of work.},
