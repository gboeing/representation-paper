\begin{abstract}
As the rental housing market increasingly moves online, the Internet offers divergent possible futures: either the promise of more-equal access to information for previously marginalized housing seekers, or a reproduction of longstanding inequities. Biases in online listings' representativeness would affect different communities' access to housing search information, reinforcing old segregation patterns and constructing new digital inequalities. They would also impact housing practitioners' and researchers' ability to draw broad market insights from listings to understand rental supply and affordability. This study examines millions of Craigslist rental listings across the US and finds that they spatially concentrate and significantly over-represent whiter, wealthier, and better-educated communities. Other significant differences between over- and under-represented groups exist in age, language, college enrollment, rent, poverty, and household size. These listings over-represent majority-white census tracts more than twice as often as black or Hispanic tracts. Housing seekers in whiter, higher-income, and more-expensive communities have a surplus of information available online to aid their searches, while those in other communities continue to face an information deficit.

\section{Introduction}

Large portions of the rental housing market have moved online over the past decade. Today, rental listings are primarily posted on websites like Craigslist, which holds a dominant position in the US and is the nation's 15\textsuperscript{th} most-visited website overall. According to the 2015 American Housing Survey, nearly 30\% of renters in central cities used a site like Craigslist to find their homes, and researchers increasingly turn to it to assess market supply. However, it is not well-understood to what extent online listings represent the complete rental market. Are different kinds of neighborhoods and demographic groups over- or under-represented? Biases can impact information access and housing search costs, as well as the conclusions that housing researchers and policymakers can draw from listings data.

This study assesses online rental market representativeness at the census tract scale, using a dataset of millions of Craigslist listings across the US. It explores the sociodemographics of over- and under-represented tracts and estimates a regression model to examine these traits' effects on representation. It finds that online rental listings are spatially concentrated and over-represent whiter, wealthier, and better-educated tracts. Majority-white tracts are over-represented more than twice as often as Hispanic or black tracts. Although large swaths of this market are affordable to low-to-moderate income and black families, housing seekers in whiter, wealthier, better-educated, and more-expensive communities have a surplus of information online to aid their searches while seekers in other communities face a digital information deficit. As the rental housing market moves online, biases in this information supply construct new digital inequalities that shape housing search options and the conclusions planners can draw about rapidly-evolving markets.

This paper reviews the landscape of online rental housing listings, theories of digital participation, and the open question of market representativeness. Then it describes the methods used to address this question before presenting their findings. Finally it discusses what this reveals about representation, access to information, and implications for housing scholars and practitioners.




\section{Background}

Despite the growing pervasiveness of online listings in the rental housing market, it remains unknown how they represent the full market. If they are not representative---i.e., if sampling biases exist---who is over- or under-represented? As information sources about available rental housing move online, different communities' access to information and capacity to find housing depend both on listings' representativeness and communities' abilities/interests in engaging them. This can be considered from the supply-side (i.e., the supply of information by landlords, managers, and brokers) and the demand-side (i.e., housing seekers' Internet usage and search behavior).

On the supply-side, information about available housing units for rent traditionally appeared in local newspaper classifieds. Today, however, listings overwhelmingly appear online. Craigslist in particular has become the foremost such venue in the US, even as potential competitors like Facebook, Zillow, and Trulia now try to compete with its near monopoly in online listings \citep{hau_newspaper_2006,brown_rental_2014,seamans_responses_2014,kroft_does_2014,yurieff_facebook_2017}. Researchers have increasingly turned to Craigslist listings to study individual metropolitan markets \citep[e.g.][]{brown_converting_2017,im_energy_2017,halket_homeownership_2015,mallach_meeting_2010}. Craigslist may also provide a window into underexplored informal segments of the rental market \citep{wegmann_understanding_2012}. Most studies of demographic representation on Craigslist have focused on discrimination by landlords \citep{ahmed_can_2010,hanson_landlords_2011,hanson_field_2014,hogan_racial_2011,carlsson_discrimination_2014} and the Fair Housing Act \citep[e.g.][]{larkin_criminal_2010,oliveri_discriminatory_2010,wilemon_fair_2009,ross_cyberspace:_2009}. \citet{boeing_new_2017} examined Craigslist listings across the US, concluding future research was needed to understand sociodemographic submarket representativeness.

On the demand-side, who consumes this online supply of information about available rental units? Online housing search depends on Internet access and usage. The rise in Internet ubiquity over the past 20 years has been accompanied by concerns about a growing digital divide between information \enquote{haves} and \enquote{have-nots} \citep{hersberger_are_2003}. This divide may result from cultural differences or social inequalities: age, race, wealth, and education impact exposure and access to technology as well as attitudes, skills, and cultural norms in usage \citep{jones_u.s._2009,robinson_digital_2015}. Younger, whiter, better-educated, and higher-income Americans have higher Internet usage rates than other groups \citep{porter_using_2006}. Internet use and search engine behavior vary among different racial groups and as a function of native language \citep{slate_digital_2002,weber_who_2011}. Older adults are less likely to use the Internet, and this effect is more pronounced among those who are low-income, black, or Hispanic \citep{choi_digital_2013}.

The race gap is closing, however, and as of 2018, 89\% of white adults used the Internet versus 88\% of Hispanic and 87\% of black adults \citep{pew_research_center_internet_2018}. But it is less clear how this translates to housing search. Pre-Internet, \citet{newburger_sources_1995} found that black homebuyers relied on fewer information sources than whites did, possibly due to housing information being harder to acquire in black neighborhoods. \citet{farley_racial_1996} found that blacks relied more on social ties and newspaper ads to find housing than whites did, due to longstanding practices of real estate agents providing more information to white than black housing seekers and steering them toward different neighborhoods \citep[cf.][]{kwate_spatial_2013}. Beyond race, \citet{deboer_resident_1985} argued that elderly housing seekers face higher search costs, more-constrained radii, and fewer information resources than younger seekers. Imperfect information and unequal access to it can produce housing market disequilibrium, with overpayment rates correlated with seeker characteristics.

Do online housing markets attenuate or reinforce these traditional disparities? The Internet could potentially offer information-disadvantaged housing seekers more information for their searches, but it remains unclear if this potential has been realized \citep{decker_housing_2010}. \citet{palm_residential_2001} found no difference in race, income, or education among those who did versus did not use the Internet in their search, but did find age differences. \citet[][p.~598]{krysan_does_2008} however found that blacks were significantly less likely to use the Internet to search for housing than whites, concluding: \enquote{Given the rapid growth of the Internet in renting and selling housing, the observed racial digital divide is a point of some concern.}

These studies of representation and participation focus on \emph{demand}. However, the representativeness of available rental housing \emph{supply} online remains underexplored. If Internet usage differs between demographic groups---and if certain kinds of communities appear more in online rental listings---it could perpetuate neighborhood segregation. It could also reproduce longstanding information inequalities as new digital inequalities, where privileged communities can obtain a surplus of relevant housing information while others face information deficits. Due to its prevalence, Craigslist offers a useful data source for studying the representativeness of online housing markets. This technology platform and the listings it contains shape human market behaviors---socially-constructed relations of exchange---while chronicling them for researchers.


\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data}

Building on this context, this study investigates if online rental listings over- or under-represent different communities and how community characteristics influence supply-side representativeness. To answer these questions, we examine online rental housing listings across the US. The study sites comprise the 12,505 census tracts within the core cities of the 50 most populous US metropolitan statistical areas, ignoring tracts that contain no rental units. We adopt the dataset of 11 million Craigslist rental housing listings collected in spring 2014 by \citet{boeing_new_2017}, filtered to remove duplicate listings and extreme outliers, and to retain only geolocated listings. This results in a clean sample of 1.4 million listings.

We spatially join these tracts and rental listings then attach corresponding 2014 American Community Survey (ACS) tract-level data (Table \ref{tab:variables_list}). Although landlords, not neighborhoods, are the agents of interest, tract-level data offer the finest-scale approximation. Due to survey design, the ACS provides average rental vacancy rates rather than snapshots of vacancies at specific times, but no existing dataset does so at sub-metropolitan scales. US Postal Service vacancy data provide finer spatial granularity, but---crucially---lack tenure. Despite imperfections, the ACS offers the best data available to explore these questions rigorously.


\subsection{Assessing representation}

We count how many listings appear in each tract as count $\kappa$. This represents the empirical/observed distribution. The ACS provides the number of vacant units for rent, $\tau$, in each tract. The average tract contains 55 vacant rental units and 10 listings. Then we calculate a proportional reallocation, $\phi$, of these rental listings for each tract in each city as:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:allocation}
	\phi_t = \frac{\kappa_c \tau_t}{\tau_c}
\end{equation}

\begin{table*}[htbp]
	\centering
	\small
	\caption{List of variables. Census sources refer to 2014 ACS tract-level data from which variable is derived. Percent estimates are converted to proportions by dividing by 100. \$ are 2014 inflation-adjusted US dollars.}
	\label{tab:variables_list}
	\input{table_variables.tex}
\end{table*}

where $\phi_t$ indicates how many of the observed Craigslist listings in city $c$ would appear in its tract $t$ if these listings were redistributed across $c$'s tracts according to each's proportion of $c$'s total vacant units for rent. This represents the theoretical/expected distribution. We then calculate\footnote{We add 1 to the numerator and denominator to maintain symmetry, avoid logarithm of zero, and make the ratio more expressive.} each tract's over- or under-representation on Craigslist, $\rho$, as:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:representation}
	\rho_t = \frac{\kappa_t + 1}{\phi_t + 1}
\end{equation}

Thus, when $\rho=1$, a tract has the same number of rental listings on Craigslist that we would expect if the city's listings were redistributed among its tracts in proportion to each's share of the city's total vacant rental units. Higher and lower values indicate over- and under-representation respectively. Finally, we calculate Gini coefficients to measure how evenly the listings are distributed across the study sites. A coefficient of 1 indicates that a single tract contains all the listings, while a coefficient of 0 indicates that they are perfectly evenly distributed among all tracts.





\subsection{Group differences}

Once we have assembled the ACS data and the Craigslist representation indicator $\rho$, we examine the differences between over-represented ($\rho>1$) and under-represented ($\rho<1$) tracts using $t$-tests and calculating effect sizes as Cohen's $d$:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:cohen_d}
	d = \frac{\mu_o - \mu_u}{\sigma_p}
\end{equation}

where $\mu_o$ and $\mu_u$ are the means of the over- and under-represented tracts and $\sigma_p$ represents their pooled standard deviation. This measures a standardized magnitude of difference between these two groups---namely, by how many standard deviations their means differ. By convention, a $d$ of 0.8 or greater represents a large effect, 0.5--0.8 represents a medium effect, 0.2--0.5 a small effect, and values below 0.2 a negligible effect \citep{cohen_power_1992}.





\subsection{Regression analysis}

The $\rho$ ratio is more useful if we further control for local inventory and turnover, which could influence listing volume. To investigate the \textit{ceteris paribus} effects of different sociodemographic and built environment characteristics on Craigslist representation, we estimate a regression model via ordinary least squares:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:regression_formula}
	y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon
\end{equation}

where the response variable $y$ is Craigslist representation ($\rho$), $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $x_1$ is a vector of tract sociodemographic and neighborhood variables, $x_2$ is a vector of 49 city dummy variables, $\epsilon$ is random error, and $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are vectors of parameters to be estimated. To correctly specify a model that is linear-in-parameters, we log-transform the response\footnote{Ratios lack symmetry: when $\kappa < \phi$, $\rho$ ranges from 0 to 1, but when  $\kappa > \phi$, $\rho$ ranges from 1 to infinity. The logarithm corrects this: when $\kappa = \phi$, $\rho = 1$ and $\log(\rho) = 0$. It produces symmetry as $\log(a/b) = -\log(b/a)$. That is, $\log(a/b) = \log(a)-\log(b)$, so we are evaluating the algebraic difference between logarithmic values.} and some of the predictors in $x_1$. Thus we can interpret the coefficients on log-transformed predictors as elasticities (the percent change in the response given a 1\% increase in the predictor) and those on untransformed predictors as semi-elasticities (the percent change in the response given a 1 unit increase in the predictor).

We control for intermetropolitan variation with $x_2$ and for rental inventory and turnover with three variables in $x_1$: the count of rental units, the proportion of the population living in the same residence as a year ago, and the rental vacancy rate. Neighborhood character variables include the tract's median rooms per home, proportion of structures built before 1940, distance to the city center, and average commute time. These control for typical building size and age as well as location centrality and job accessibility.

Sociodemographic predictors include the tract's median household income, median gross rent, average renter household size, the proportions of the population 20--34 years old and 65 or older, the proportion currently enrolled in college/graduate school, the proportion with a bachelor's or graduate degree, the proportion that speaks English-only, and the proportions of the population that are white\footnote{\enquote{White} is shorthand for non-Hispanic white.}, black, or Hispanic. The model includes an interaction term---the white proportion $\times$ median income---to explore how race moderates the effect of income on representation.




\section{Findings}

\subsection{Spatial compression}

Across these cities, the tract-level observed distribution of Craigslist listings, $\kappa$, has a Gini coefficient of 0.80, while the expected distribution, $\phi$, has a coefficient of 0.70---i.e., rental listings are more concentrated than a proportional distribution would be---but this effect is uneven between cities. In four markets (San Francisco, San Jose, Oklahoma City, and Las Vegas), the $\phi$ Gini is slightly higher (by 0.3\%--7.8\%) than that of $\kappa$, indicating rental listings are slightly more dispersed. However, in St. Louis, Providence, Miami, and Hartford, the $\kappa$ Gini is 1.7--2.2 times that of $\phi$, suggesting an extreme spatial compression of listings in these rental markets. As this concentration suggests, most tracts are at least slightly under-represented on Craigslist (i.e., $\rho$ < 1), but this varies by demographics. 52\% of majority-white tracts are over-represented, compared to only 19\% of majority-black and 22\% of majority-Hispanic tracts. Examining the racial composition of tracts with $\rho$ < 0.25 (i.e., with fewer than 25\% of the listings we expect), only 11\% of majority-white tracts are as such \enquote{very} under-represented, but 27\% of black and 35\% of Hispanic tracts are.

\subsection{Differences between groups}

	\caption{Share of total rental listings (expected versus observed distributions) in tracts with various characteristics.}
	\label{fig:tract_shares}
\end{figure*}

Sociodemographic and other neighborhood characteristics differ significantly between over- and under-represented tracts nationwide. Figure \ref{fig:variable_distributions} depicts the distributions of several key variables, illustrating clear differences between these two groups. In particular, the white proportion's distribution practically inverts between over- and under-represented tracts. Six variables have medium effect sizes, either positive or negative (Table \ref{tab:effects_over_under}): median income, gross rent, the white population proportion, the proportion with a bachelor's/graduate degree, the proportion enrolled in college/graduate school, the proportion below poverty, and the proportion experiencing rent burden. Twelve more have small, significant effects. Figure \ref{fig:tract_shares} shows how the expected and observed distributions of listings diverge. For instance, we expect only 33\% of listings to appear in tracts with median income exceeding \$55,000, but instead we observe 56\%. Similarly we expect majority-white tracts to contain 39\% of listings, but instead they contain 59\%.

\begin{table*}[tbp]
	\centering
	\small
	\caption{Differences between over/under-represented tracts nationwide: $d$ represents effect size, $\delta$ represents difference in means, *indicates $t$-test significance at $p$ < 0.05.}

\end{table*}

\end{table*}

\begin{figure*}[tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig_var_dists_cities.png}
	\caption{Variables' estimated probability densities across over/under-represented tracts in different cities.}
	\label{fig:var_dists_cities}
\end{figure*}

On average compared to under-represented tracts, over-represented tracts have a white population proportion 20 percentage-points\footnote{We distinguish between percentage-point differences, which are additive, and percent changes, which are not.} (pp) higher, a Hispanic proportion 8 pp lower, and a black proportion 15 pp lower (Table \ref{tab:effects_over_under}). The proportion that speaks English-only is 8 pp higher and the foreign-born proportion is 4 pp lower. Average median home values are about \$79,000 higher, median incomes \$21,000 higher, and median gross rents \$200 higher. The proportion of the population with a bachelor's/graduate degree is 17 pp higher and the proportion currently enrolled in college/graduate school is 7 pp higher, on average. In over-represented tracts the proportion of the population below poverty is 9 pp lower and the rent-burdened proportion is 8 pp lower. On average, over-represented tracts are 0.4 km closer to the city center and offer commutes 3.3 minutes shorter, but have slightly lower population densities, smaller household sizes, and higher proportions of single-unit detached housing.

These differences are significant, but are they consistent across cities? Although Craigslist represents certain cities more evenly than others, some consistent patterns emerge in the per-city differences between over- and under-represented tracts (Table \ref{tab:effects_cities}). Average median income is higher (i.e., $d$ > 0) in over-represented tracts in every city, and more than 1.5 standard deviations ($\sigma$) higher in Miami and Chicago (Figure \ref{fig:var_dists_cities}). Rents are higher in over-represented tracts in every city with a significant difference, and more than 1 $\sigma$ higher in 7 cities, again led by Miami and Chicago. The proportion of the population with a bachelor's/graduate degree is higher in every city with a significant difference, and more than 1.5 $\sigma$ higher in Miami, Hartford, Chicago, and New Orleans. The proportion enrolled in college/graduate school is higher in every city with a significant difference, and more than 1 $\sigma$ higher in Miami, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Similarly, the white proportion is higher in every city with a significant difference, and more than 1 $\sigma$ higher in 7 of these, led by Miami and New Orleans (Figure \ref{fig:var_dists_cities}). However, the proportion that speaks English-only is more divisive: while some cities have medium-sized negative effects, many more have medium or large positive effects. Finally, the proportion below poverty is lower in every city with a significant difference, led by Miami, Houston, Washington, and New Orleans, and the average renter household size is lower in all but one city (Las Vegas) with a significant difference, led by Hartford, Miami, and Boston.

\subsection{Regression results}

Regression analysis reveals the effects of various predictors while holding other variables constant (Table \ref{tab:regression_results}). The model performs well: variables of interest have the expected signs and the coefficient of determination is 0.46---surprisingly high considering the noisiness of these user-generated data. In terms of model specification and diagnostics, it demonstrates good linearity, homoskedasticity, approximately normally-distributed residuals, and minimal multicollinearity.

A \textit{ceteris paribus} \$10 increase in tract median rent increases representation on Craigslist by 0.57\%, a 1 pp increase in the proportion with a bachelor's/graduate degree increases it 1.05\%, and a 1 pp increase in the proportion that speaks English-only increases it 0.62\%. A 1 pp increase in the 20--34 year old population proportion increases it by 0.40\% but a 1 pp increase in the proportion age 65 and older decreases it 0.51\%. A 1\% increase in distance from the city center decreases tract representation on Craigslist by 0.12\% and a 1 pp increase in the proportion of structures built before 1940 decreases it 0.28\%. Although a 1 room increase per home increases it by 4.5\%, a 1\% increase in renter household size decreases it 0.21\%. A 1 pp increase in the black proportion of the population decreases representation by 0.45\% and a 1 pp increase in the Hispanic proportion decreases it 0.23\%. 

The marginal effect of income on Craigslist representation depends on race. With a population that is 10\% white, a 1\% increase in median income increases representation by 0.33\%. But with a 90\% white population, a 1\% increase in median income increases it by only 0.06\%. Similarly, in poorer tracts, \enquote{whiteness} has a more positive effect: when median income is \$10,000, a 1 pp increase in the white population proportion increases Craigslist representation by 0.08\%. But when median income is \$100,000, a 1 pp increase in the white proportion decreases it by 0.71\%.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Representativeness}

These data distill the collective behavior and intentions of millions of people listing rental units online. They do not, however, represent all market segments and activity. It becomes essential to understand these biases as housing seekers and researchers increasingly turn to the Internet to explore housing markets. Craigslist listings spatially concentrate more than expected and some rental markets---such as Miami and Hartford---demonstrate extreme compression. Such cities consistently appear among those with the largest differences between over- and under-represented tracts across multiple sociodemographic variables. Their online housing markets are spatially concentrated and digitally segregated by race and class.

Miami's disparities starkly illustrate this. Its average population proportion with a degree and white proportion are both 2 standard deviations higher in over- versus under-represented tracts. Its average median income and rent are both 1.5 standard deviations higher. On average in Miami, 51\% of the population has a degree in over-represented tracts versus only 17\% in under-represented tracts. 33\% versus 7\% of the population is white, household incomes are \$67,000 versus \$28,000, and home values are \$371,000 versus \$163,000. Nationwide, tracts over-represented on Craigslist are significantly better-educated, whiter, and wealthier than under-represented tracts. They feature higher rents and larger homes, but smaller household sizes. They contain more college students, more English-only speakers, and fewer immigrants. Majority-white tracts are over-represented 2.4 and 2.7 times as often as Hispanic and black tracts. Conversely, only 1 in 9 majority-white tracts is \enquote{very} under-represented, compared to over a quarter of black and over a third of Hispanic tracts.

Controlling for confounds to disentangle effects, we find that higher rents and larger proportions of the population that are college-educated, are enrolled students, and speak English-only significantly predict greater representation on Craigslist. Newer housing stock, closer proximity to the city center, and more rooms per home---but smaller renter household sizes---predict greater representation. Higher incomes have a universally positive effect on representation, but a larger one in tracts with higher minority populations. Although larger black and Hispanic proportions consistently predict lower representation, the effect of white population is moderated by income. In very poor tracts, a whiter population predicts greater representation, but high-income communities are less-represented on Craigslist when they are whiter. Although over-represented tracts are whiter than under-represented tracts, the white proportion actually has a small or negative effect when we control for correlated factors such as income and education.

\subsection{Digital divide?}

Beyond identifying sampling biases, these findings contribute supply-side evidence to theories of the digital divide and disparate housing search. Black and elderly Americans are less likely to search for housing online, and their communities are less-represented on Craigslist. Immigrants and non-English speakers may use soft ties rather than an English-language website to advertise or seek housing. Wealthier whites may be more likely to hire brokers, influencing how race and income can moderate each other's effects.

This raises a cause-and-effect/supply-and-demand question. Do landlords in certain communities advertise online less because they know their market segment uses the Internet less to search for housing? Or do certain communities use the Internet less to search for housing because of unfamiliarity, its dearth of information, and past experiences with racialized interactions? If a member of this target market rarely finds suitable units when she does search online, why would she continue doing so? A relative affinity for Internet use in wealthier, whiter, better-educated neighborhoods could stimulate the local supply of online information, or local landlords in certain neighborhoods may prefer to advertise online because their own Internet usage reflects that of the surrounding community. A landlord may even avoid Craigslist to filter and limit the number of potential applicants \citep{mendez_professional_2016}. These patterns likely reflect a path-dependent interaction of supply and demand feedback loops, suppressing some communities' usage while buttressing others'.

Craigslist's dominance in housing listings varies within and between cities. This study identifies structural differences in its utilization between different kinds of cities and neighborhoods, but not \emph{why} each submarket behaves differently. There could be many factors at play. Moreover, \emph{not} being on Craigslist could be to the advantage of underprivileged neighborhoods if it makes them less available to gentrification and displacement. If these communities' members tend to search for housing online less than whiter/wealthier seekers do, and if available units in these neighborhoods appear online less, they may be less-easily \enquote{discovered} by Internet-savvy, rent-raising outsiders. Information under-representation might thus shield communities in a redoubt of illegibility.

What about market segmentation? Concerns of digital inequality could be moot if online listings merely match high-end housing supply and demand, while other segments simply use a different, suitable medium instead. But---crucially---Craigslist does not merely represent the high-end of the market. 49\% of these listings are affordable (i.e., asking rent < 30\% of income) for households just below the 2014 US median household income, and 23\% are affordable for households just below the black median. Large swaths of the Craigslist market \emph{are} within the reach of low-to-moderate income and black families. Housing brokers historically provided different information to white and black housing seekers: although the Internet promises information democratization, these disparities seem to continue online.

\subsection{Future work}

This analysis has some limitations that invite future research. Although Craigslist does not constitute the entire online listings marketplace, it holds a dominant market position. However, these listings were collected during spring and could reflect seasonal biases: future work can confirm these findings with longer-term longitudinal data. This study examined core cities, not wider metropolitan areas. Although many core cities contain extensive suburban neighborhoods, the inclusion of further-flung suburbs and exurbs might change estimated model parameters. Future work can build on these preliminary findings by examining entire metropolitan areas or estimating individual local models. It can also unpack unit characteristics to further explore the appropriate matching of under-represented communities to available units.

But despite these caveats, our findings conform to theory and reasonable expectations, providing a first glimpse into how online listings represent the rental market. This study modeled tract-level representation, but future research can investigate how demographic and neighborhood characteristics contribute to asking rents and the difference between asking rents and corresponding ACS rents. Finally, given these substantial demographic disparities, future work can explore how tracts change over time to investigate online listings' role in the broader dynamics of gentrification.

\section{Conclusion}

If information is power in today's cities and economies, then disparate access to it shapes community futures, opportunities, and equity. As the rental housing market moves online, data sources like Craigslist offer an opportunity to understand affordability and available rental supply in real-time. They do not, however, provide a holistic view of the housing market: this online information exchange over- and under-represents different communities. This study provided a glimpse into the supply-side of digital inequality. Housing seekers in whiter, wealthier, better-educated, and more-expensive communities have a surplus of information online to aid their search, while seekers in other communities face an information deficit, perpetuating historical patterns. This bias can influence the reinforcing feedback loops of supply and demand in community usage, as well as the conclusions that housing planners can draw by collecting these data.
